    <h1 class="text-center mt-5 bg-warning text-light">Ans of all the Question</h1>

    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-center fw-bold">Local storage vs Session storage</h1>
        <p class="mt-5">Session and local storage are browser storage methods that let you store data alongside stateless HTTP requests. They are an alternative to cookie-based storage and have many uses in web development.</p>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Session storage</span> is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to the same site, you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab" feature in your browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific details of a "session". Instead, focus on the core concept: session storage is temporary.</p>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Local storage</span> maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in different tabs or windows. It is also permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-center fw-bold">Global scope vs Local scope</h1>
        
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Global scope</span>contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</p>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Local scope</span>contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where itâ€™s declared.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-center fw-bold">How Event loop works</h1>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">The event loop</span> works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event").</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-center fw-bold">How many ways to get Undefined</h1>
        <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
    </div>
